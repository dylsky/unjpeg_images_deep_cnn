# Unjpeg images
Petty django & keras+tensorflow application. Feautes:
* embedded trained network, nn.hdf5
* neural_network_backend -> run runner.py to train new network. Something something for 64x64 images
* run UI from root "manage.py runserver", feed it with an image and trained network (each time, sadly)
